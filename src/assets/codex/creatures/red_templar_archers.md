Take aim. Red lyrium isn't the weak stuff they fed you all your life. The song is deeper. It's got a will of its own. Tame it, and it will do things the Chantry's instructors never dreamed of.

Listen. Focus on the arrow in your hand. Pour power into it when it leaves the bow. That strength can fly across a battlefield and punch a hole through the thickest armor.

Soon you won't need to stop to hear it. Practice, and the song will always be in your blood.

And fire.

——Red templar archer, instructing new recruits starting to take red lyrium
