Dearest J—

I agree it is <i> surprising </i> that the Fereldans come as equals, but the Exalted Council is in the heart of southern Orlais. That cannot be lost on our neighbors.

<h3> If Briala was supported during Wicked Eyes and Wicked Hearts: </h3>

Marquise Briala has, of course, stayed out of sight, but do not believe for a second that the rabbit is not meddling when none can can see her. The Inquisition gave her that title, but she would not hesitate to wind them so tightly around her, they'll choke.

<h3> If Gaspard was supported during Wicked Eyes and Wicked Hearts: </h3>

Gaspard rode out ten days ago to inspect his chevaliers on the border, while "placing full trust in the Exalted Council." Even after all these years, the court hasn't accepted that our emperor's tactics are as simple as they seem. If Ferelden takes the day, he will attempt to deflect the blame without upsetting their alliance. If the Inquisition yields to us, Gaspard will celebrate having an even closer ally to himself.

If he is in the mood, our emperor may cap either outcome with a beheading or two. He has been eyeing a few lords sideways lately.

<h3> If Celene survived Wicked Eyes and Wicked Hearts: </h3>

Empress Celene has stayed in Val Royeaux to appease a delegation of Nevarrans, or so her messengers say. It is obvious the empress stays away to dodge the demands that she bring the Inquisition to heel. One would almost think that Celene believes they will find a way out of their bind. So strangely naïve, at her age!

<h3> If Celene reconciled with Briala during Wicked Eyes and Wicked Hearts: </h3>

Empress Celene came out for the first ceremonies, then retired into her chambers for the rest of the talks. A day later, Marquise Briala came visiting "on important matters of state." Suffice to say, I do not think we will see them at the Council—Celene and the rabbit cavort like lovers half their age. Of course, the foolish assume our empress is so distracted that they might safely overreach themselves, an idea even more disastrous than the new carpeting in the north wing. (That shade of lime? Really?)
