Amazing creatures, dragons. Every one I've encountered has had a unique personality. This one, for example, enjoys being around water. Saw her splashing about. A remarkable sight. I would joined in her revels had Kalev not held me back. Ah, Kalev. A good porter, but timid. I told Kalev and the others: dragons much prefer to eat beasts of the wilds rather than humans.

Unfortunately, I was proven wrong, a day later; the creature turned away from a gurgut to go after poor Kalev. I hope the brave little soul got to see the magnificent dome of her gullet. I'm certain it's like the inside of the Grand Cathedral.
