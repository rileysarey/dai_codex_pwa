<h3> If the inquisition has yet to choose a side in the Mage-Templar conflict... </h3>

The Inquisition's growing presence in the area represents a threat to the operation. Focus efforts on discouraging any further exploration in the area, particularly any efforts to give comfort to the refugees at the crossroads. We cannot have people putting down roots here.

<h3> If the inquisition recruits the Mages... </h3>

Whoever the red templars are, they have become very interested in the area. Their appearance suggests a familiarity with the product that cannot be coincidence. Focus efforts on eliminating them, ideally in such a way as to place blame on the growing Inquisition forces in the area. If we can get the two groups to kill each other, that should be less work for all of us.

<h3> If the inquisition recruits the Templars... </h3>

Whoever the Venatori are, they have become very interested in the area. Whether they are searching for artifacts in old ruins or actually after the product, they are too close to our operations and have proved too dangerous to negotiate with. Focus efforts on eliminating them, ideally in such a way as to place blame on the growing Inquisition forces in the area. If we can get the two groups to kill each other, that should be less work for all of us.
