<i> The entries in this diary alternate between an elegant, well-rounded script and a slanted scrawl: </i>

I never expected to find such tranquility here. No nattering crowds, no drifts of refuse. I should have been born in the country. I am only disappointed to learn I am here to verify translations—a drudge's work. But in the evenings, there is time for my own studies without distraction or fear of being branded "apostate" for my reading.

<i> It is time to rise to my capabilities. </i>

The Elder One has bound spirits far beyond what I thought a mage could manage. We speak of Him becoming a god, but surely He cannot be considered mortal any longer.

<i> What steps must a man take to become such a being? </i>

It is an excellent question. To bask in His glory must be enough and yet... and yet, I cannot let the curiosity go.

Does the Elder One take power from demons? I've learned much about their summoning and binding. I was surprised to find so many I recognized from the Circle among the Venatori, but they talk freely of rites and rituals forbidden in the Imperium.

<i> They offer such power, for so little blood. </i>

But I must not rush. Tempting as it is.

<i> For have I not grown in skill and measure? </i>

I cannot draw attention to myself. We will leave after we unearth these dwarven relics, not stay to practice binding the Fade's denizen's to our will.

<i> Even though it would be so easy here, in a place where the Veil has grown so thin. </i>

I am tired of this fear. Fear of harm I may do to myself. Fear of letting opportunity slip from me.

<i> I must leave it behind me. </i>

Binding a demon of higher power is dangerous...

<i> Yet my skills have grown. </i>

But what else will show the others what I'm capable of, what I can offer! <i> I am a mage of the Imperium, and I will claim my birthright. The spirits through the Veil will see my power, and they will kneel—or I will make them. </i>
