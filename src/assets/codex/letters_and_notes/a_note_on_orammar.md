Inquisitor,

As you've already heard, Orzammar has urgent need of our services. The underground earthquakes in the Deep Roads threaten to cave in countless lyrium mines. If this happens, it would all but cut off the supply of lyrium to the surface, I don't need to tell you how many former templars in the Inquisition rely on that lyrium.

It is imperative that we remain in Orzammar's good graces. Their politics may not require as much finesse as the Grand Game of Orlais, but dwarven society can be just as perilous. Orzammar is one of two remaining thaigs that once made up their empire, and its citizens are a proud people who are accustomed to hardship and lean heavily on tradition. A dwarf's caste means everything.

While you are not traveling to the capital itself, you will be dealing with a representative from its Shaperate. I am told her name is Valta and her father is a highly respected member of the Smith Caste. Leliana has discovered little else about her, which isn't surprising, considering how tightly Orzammar holds its secrets. I caution you to treat this representative with the utmost respect. We are dealing with a proud people with long memories. Once a grudge is held...well, I'm sure you've heard what they say about rocks and dwarven stubbornness.
