Vain hope: Someone better at this than me takes over before the survivor expires. Notes in case.

<b> —Day One— </b>

Clammy. Shallow breathing. Pulse over-fast. Not responsive. Pupils dilated.
Mage says his/her scarring "mark" is thrumming with unknown magic.
Wish we could station a templar in here, just in case.

<b> —Day Two— </b>

Pulse normal, breathing normal.
Still unresponsive; careful drop-feed of prep. elfroot extract to hasten his/her recovery.
A lot of thrashing. Mutters about too many eyes. Something about "the grey." Encouraging?

<b> —Day Three— </b>

Less thrashing. Some response to stimulus. Vitals seem solid.
Two attempts so far by locals to break into the chantry to kill my patient.
All this work to save his/her life, and will they just execute him/her?
Will inform Lady Cassandra I expect him/her to wake before the morn.
