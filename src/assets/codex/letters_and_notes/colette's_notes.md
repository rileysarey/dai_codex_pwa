"Two stood. Felled sixty true before our triumph. A breath in the hunt and let rest the lowlanders, worthy of the Lady's care."

Inscription discovered in Tevinter ruin within Frostback Basin—not Tevinter in origin. Script style and surrounding symbolism mark text as Avvar. Writing not widespread in holds—place marked by a leader or augur? Few lowlanders known to be in area at time.

Glass in area likely means templar presence, long past. Samples prepared for Professor Kenric's opinion.
