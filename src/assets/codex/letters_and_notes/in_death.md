"In war, victory. In peace, vigilance. In death, sacrifice."

My brothers and sisters in vigilance,

By drinking of the chalice, you are a Grey Warden.
Though you perished, you died with your blood joined
with mine. I honor your sacrifice, and carry your
memory into battle.

Meline of Arlesans, I remember you.
Leonide de Firmin, I remember you.
Audwen, I remember you.
