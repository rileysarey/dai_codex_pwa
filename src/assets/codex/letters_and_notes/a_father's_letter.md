<i> This letter never reached its intended recipient: </i>

My dearest Fennela,

How are you? How is your Aunt Kaitlen? My dear girl would never give trouble, I hope? How are your studies? Perhaps you could read some of this letter to her, to show her how much you're learning.

I am sorry to have been away for so long. I have a duty. Remember when mother was very sick, and she asked you to fetch her water, and you did it because you loved her? It's like that. Sometimes we have to do difficult things, because they help other people that we love. The country is ill, and I have to try to make her better. Don't worryâ€”I am not alone here, and now we have special medicine that will make us stronger so we can fight better.

It won't be long 'til all the mages are all gone and we're safe again. I will be home soon.

All my love and prayers,
Father
