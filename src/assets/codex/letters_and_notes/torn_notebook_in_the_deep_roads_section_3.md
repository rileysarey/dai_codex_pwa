Trying to remember that old bedtime song about Mythal. My mother sang it the night before the darkspawn came for my clan. It's the last time I ever heard her voice.

Ir sa tel'nal,
Mythal las ma theneras.
Ir san'a emma.
Him solas evanuris.
Da'durgen'lin,
Banal malas elgara.
Bellanaris, bellanaris.

Written beside each elven line is a corresponding phrase, likely a translation:

I am empty, filled with nothing(?),
Mythal gives you dreams.
It fills you, within you(?),
Making our leaders proud.
My little stones,
Never yours the sun.
Forever, forever.


Hahren said we had lost some of the old words. What if they have changed? Durgen'lin from durgen'len? Little <i> dwarves, </i> never yours the sun? What did Mythal do here?

Something's wrong. The lights in the walls are fading. Going to find help. It's not safe. Without light...

Itwa-ost: You all fall
Itwa-adim: They all fall
Itwasaam: We all fall
