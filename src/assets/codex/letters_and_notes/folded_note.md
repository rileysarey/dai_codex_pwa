Captain Lowen,

I don't want grumbling in the lower ranks that our Lord Corypheus handpicked Grey Wardens to be part of His honor guard over His templars. Our charge is not to understand His will. It is only to obey it.

Besides, our Master's still sore He lost all but a few dozen enslaved Grey Wardens to the Inquisitor at Adamant. If your soldiers are smart, they'll keep quiet about it.

Lieutenant Keldon
