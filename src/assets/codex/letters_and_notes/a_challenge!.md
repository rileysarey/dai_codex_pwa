You ruddy bastard!

You'd be laying at the bottom of the ocean if it weren't for me. That Marlin would've spiked and dropped you. I save your life and this is how you repay me? That catch was ours-we both worked for it. You're not getting away with this. I'm getting the gold you owe me, even if I have to beat it out of you. Just so you don't run off like the little shit I know you are: <i> I did your sister. </i> That's right.

So if you've got the stones, meet me by the old camp. We'll settle this.

Terrence
