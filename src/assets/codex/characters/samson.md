<h1 class="title-sm">Samson</h1>
<p>I want this made clear to every man and woman in our army: do not challenge the red templars' leader, General Samson, on your own.</p>

<p>You may have heard stories of how Samson used to be a templar in Kirkwall until he was thrown out of the Order, that he became a vagrant begging for coin to buy lyrium. That man no longer exists. The fiend who attacked us at Haven had the strength of a dozen men. Samson has the training of a templar and all the power of red lyrium at his command. For those who did not see it firsthand, he is as dangerous as any demon. Perhaps worse. Treat him as such.</p>

<p>I will hold personally accountable any officers who do not communicate this order to their soldiers.</p>
