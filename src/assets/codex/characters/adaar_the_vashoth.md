<h1 class="title-sm">Adaar, the Vashoth</h1>
<p>The Qunari in Par Vollen live under the Qun, a religious and philosophical doctrine dictating every aspect of their society. <span class="bracket">[</span>Player name<span class="bracket">]</span> Adaar's parents left that restrictive life before they were born, settling in the Free Marches and raising their child outside the Qun. Qunari brought up outside their society are still feared, shunned, or misunderstood by most people in the south. The average citizen of Orlais or Ferelden assumes they are cold-blooded thralls, or vicious bandits.</p>

<p><b class="inline-condition">If the Inquisitor is a warrior or rogue:</b> Qunari who are not part of the Qun, facing limited acceptance in society, often take advantage of their reputation by taking on mercenary work. <span class="bracket">[</span>Player name<span class="bracket">]</span> Adaar joined the Valo-kas mercenary company as a young adult, making a name for themself over the years as a capable and resourceful soldier. They were hired to provide protection at the Conclave, as a neutral party to stand between templars and mages.</p>

<p><b class="inline-condition">If the Inquisitor is a mage:</b> When <span class="bracket">[</span>Player name<span class="bracket">]</span> manifested a gift for magic, their parents arranged for a mage among the Tal-Vashoth to teach them how to control their talents. They joined the Valo-kas mercenary company as a young adult, making a name for themself over the years as a capable and powerful mage. <span class="bracket">[</span>Player name<span class="bracket">]</span> was hired to provide protection at the Conclave, as a neutral party to stand between templars and human mages.</p>

<p>After the disastrous explosion at the Temple of Sacred Ashes that killed the Divine, Adaar was the only survivor. Rumors that the mysterious mark on their hand is a sign of the Maker's favor were spread by those who claim they saw the divine prophet, Andraste herself, lead Adaar out of the Fade.</p>
