<h1 class="title-sm">Trevelyan, the Free Marcher</h1>
<p>The Trevelyans are nobility from Ostwick, a city-state on the southern coast of the Free Marches. It is an old and distinguished family, in good standing among its peers, and with strong ties to the Chantry. Its youngest sons and daughters—those third- or fourth-born children with little chance of becoming heirs—often join the Chantry to become templars or clerics. As the youngest child, Lord/Lady <span class="bracket">[</span>Player name<span class="bracket">]</span> Trevelyan was expected to follow suit... until the disaster at the Conclave.</p>

<p><span class="bracket">[</span>Player name<span class="bracket">]</span> was present at the Temple of Sacred Ashes as a representative of their family's interests, along with other distant relatives in the Chantry. He/She was the only survivor at the temple after the explosion. Rumors that the mysterious mark on their hand is a sign of the Maker's favor were spread by those who claim they saw the divine prophet, Andraste herself, lead Lord/Lady <span class="bracket">[</span>Player name<span class="bracket">]</span> out of the Fade.</p>

<p>A sedate place, the Ostwick Circle did not decide in favor of either templars or mages, clinging to neutrality during the rebellion. <span class="bracket">[</span>Player name<span class="bracket">]</span> was chosen as a delegate to the Conclave in the hopes their noble position would provide protection for their fellow mages while negotiation continued. Trevelyan was the only survivor of the explosion that rocked the Temple of Sacred Ashes.</p>
