<h1 class="title-sm">Briala</h1>
<p>Watch out for elves in Halamshiral.</p>

<p>Almost no one notices they're even present. A servant scrubbing floors. A waiter filling glasses. Undergardeners weeding the border. Maids and valets dressing nobles. There's no room, alcove, or alley so private you can't find one there. And they're watching. They're organized.</p>

<p>The rumor you've heard of some mastermind leading the elves is no rumor. I have reports that this "Briala" was Celene's personal spy and assassin, a bard of unusual skill. Who she's working for now we cannot confirm.</p>

<p>Say nothing. They will hear you.</p>
