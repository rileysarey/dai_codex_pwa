<p><i> Scribbled notes between Lieutenant Renn and Legionnaire Bernat: </i></p>

<p>Lieutenant Renn:</p>

<p>Sir. I reviewed our request for supplies. As your second, I am duty-bound to point out the absurd amount of ale listed. Unless we have resorted to drowning the darkspawn.</p>

<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>Legionnaire Bernat</p>

<p>Bernat,</p>

<p>Don't be ridiculous. There's no such thing as an "absurd amount of ale."</p>

<p>Renn</p>

<p>Lieutenant Renn,</p>

<p>You have requested more barrels than we have legionnaires.</p>

<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>Legionnaire Bernat</p>

<p>Bernat,</p>

<p>Can't even let a dead man have some fun. Fine. Reduce the number of barrels to half. But I expect Tapster's quality, not the piss they sent last time.</p>

<p>Renn</p>

<p>Lieutenant Renn,</p>

<p>I will make sure the Crown is aware that the ale is for the esteemed Lieutenant Renn, Vanquisher of Darkspawn, Hero of the Fifth Blight, and... what was the other title? I always forget.</p>

<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>Legionnaire Bernat</p>

<p>Owner of the boot in your arse, salroka.</p>

<p>Renn</p>
