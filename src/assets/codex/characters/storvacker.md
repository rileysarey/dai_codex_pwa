<h1 class="title-sm">Storvacker</h1>
<p>She is the hold-beast of Stone-Bear Hold. All other bears in the area are mere imitations.</p>

<p>Storvacker. How do I even begin to explain Storvacker?</p>

<p>Storvacker is flawless.</p>

<p>She has two ancient elven trees for claw sharpening and a silver honey dish.</p>

<p>I hear that her claws are valued in Denerim at 10,000 sovereigns.</p>

<p>I hear that she sells her shed fur to Orlesian master weavers in Val Royeaux.</p>

<p>Her favorite story is <i> Hard in Hightown. </i></p>

<p>One time, she met Alistair Theirin [sic], fabled warrior of the Fifth Blight, and he told her she was pretty.</p>

<p>One time, she clawed me in the face. It was amazing.</p>
