<p>My dearest Demetrius,</p>

<p>I hope this letter finds you recovered from those ghastly meetings about road repair or import taxes or whatever terribly important work has consumed your time. I applaud your patriotic efforts to maintain the Imperium's infrastructure while the horned beasts to the north wage bloody war upon us.</p>

<p>I have asked before, but you are my closest friend, and now that you have seen the stirrings of our work, I hoped you might reconsider. You cannot think your talents adequately spent on roadwork, 'Metri. You come from the blood of the Dreamers. My master will restore the Imperium to a greatness it has not seen since our ancestors walked in the Golden City. He will rule not just a nation, but the world; those who show loyalty now stand to reap the benefits when all the world kneels to the Venatori.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are more comfortable with roads. When my master returns Tevinter to the glory it deserves, he will be pleased to find the nation well paved.</p>

<p>Consider well, my friend.</p>

<p>Magister Livius Erimond of Vyrantium</p>
