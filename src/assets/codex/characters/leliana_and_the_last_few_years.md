<p>Inquisitor,</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your kind inquiries. I am doing very well, although I have been quite busy. Selecting new staff for my apartments at the Grand Cathedral has taken me so much longer than expected, and if you wouldn't mind, I would like to borrow Scout Harding for a few weeks to help me find more nugs.</p>

<p>I cannot possibly hire anyone to a permanent position without first observing them in a room full of baby nugs, and all the litters I have on hand are nearly full-grown. In any case, I will see you soon at Halamshiral.</p>

<p>Until then,</p>

<p>Leliana</p>

<p>Inquisitor,</p>

<p>Unfortunately I must report that my attempt to use nugs in place of messenger birds in the Deep Roads has not gone well.</p>

<p>On the first attempt, the nugs I released would not even go in the right direction, choosing instead to run around in circles and collide with walls while trying to squirm out from under the message canisters.</p>

<p>After considerable training, the second attempt went slightly better, with only half trying to escape their collars while the others at least tried to go in the right direction. However, none of the nugs arrived at their destination.</p>

<p>I will require some of Charter's time in dealing with an Orleasian noblewoman I believe to be intercepting my nugs. From my surveillance, she appears to be dressing them in little frocks that are simply <i> terrible. </i></p>
