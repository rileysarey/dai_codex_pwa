<h1 class="title-sm">Scout Harding</h1>
<p>Forward camp has been established in the Fereldan Hinterlands, and suitable locations for other outposts have been identified. Progress into the area proceeded ahead of projected schedules, thanks to a local volunteer.</p>

<p>For further details, read on:</p>

<p>Sleiter was ambushed and overwhelmed by bandits and might have died if not for the timely intervention of Lace Harding, who rescued Sleiter with two well-aimed stones from a sling. Her family mabari ran off the remaining three bandits. Harding and Contessa (the mabari) escorted Sleiter back to the forward camp, followed at a distance by the small herd of ambling sheep that belonged to a neighbor of the Harding family. Once there, she requested a map, which she proceeded to fill out with helpful details, most notably known bandit hideouts and ambush points. Map completed, Lace Harding took her sheep and returned home.</p>

<p>We did not expect her to return the next morning, now outfitted with a small bow and leather jerkin, and absent one hound and a herd of sheep. "Maps are all right, but nothing beats a guide," she said.</p>

<p>That was a week ago. She's still here. I took the liberty of offering her a position as a scout.</p>

<p>Yours,</p>

<p>Charter</p>
