<h1 class="title-sm">Cassandra and the Last Few Years</h1>
<p>Lord Seeker Lucius,</p>

<p>I am fully aware of the intent behind your predecessor’s declaration. Lord Seeker Lambert pried the templars away from Chantry control and led them into an assault upon all mages, for reasons you both find justified. I, however, am uncertain when the Seekers of Truth went from guarding against injustice to perpetrating it. If you truly believe that this is not the case, I suggest you look out a window at the chaos this war has caused, and ask yourself if Thedas will recover even if you are victorious. I remain at Divine Justinia’s right hand, and will stay there even if you brand me a traitor. I am sorry, but there is too much at stake to swerve from the path we willingly followed at the Chantry’s foundation.</p>

<p>—From a letter by Seeker Cassandra Pentaghast to Lord Seeker Lucius Corin, Dragon 9:39</p>

<h2 class="condition">If Cassandra becomes Divine:</h2>
<p>Now her hand is raised, a sword to pierce the sun. With iron shield she defends the faithful, let chaos be undone.</p>

<p>Canticle of Victoria 1:3</p>
