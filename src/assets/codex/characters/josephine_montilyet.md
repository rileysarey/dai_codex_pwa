<h1 class="title-sm">Josephine and the Last Few Years</h1>
<p>Seeker Cassandra:</p>

<p>Josephine Montilyet is a noble from the nation of Antiva. She was educated in Val Royeaux, where she built connections among the court. Once she finished her schooling—at a surprisingly young age—Lady Montilyet became the official diplomat between King Fulgeno of Antiva to Empress Celene of Orlais. The appointment suits her. She is well traveled, familiar with many forms of etiquette, and by all accounts a skilled negotiator.</p>

<p>If that endorsement does not suffice, Josephine is a personal friend. I have faith in her. We require someone both influential and trustworthy to be an ambassador for the Inquisition; you cannot tell me you would prefer to take the job yourself.</p>
