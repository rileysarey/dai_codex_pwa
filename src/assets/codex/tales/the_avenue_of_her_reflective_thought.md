The Avenue is inspirational, but wise travelers do not linger in their respects; not just because the bazaar awaits, but because the area before the backturned statues is treacherous.

Local legend has it that the child-empress Aimee abused the opportunity of religious repose to relieve herself beneath the gaze of Our Lady. Unable to discipline the toddling leader, her attendants instead chastised the statues, and had them turned in supposed embarrassment.

True or not, foolish youths dare each other to soil the spot in similar fashion, and a place of otherwise reverent thought always carries a faint odor about it.
