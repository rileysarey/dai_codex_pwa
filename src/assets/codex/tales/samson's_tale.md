Samson templar fame,
Raise your shield of shame.

Samson's letter caught,
Left unfought defamed.

Armor laced with blood
Shall reclaim his name.

Samson's broken heart
Shall revoke his claim.

Samson knight in red,
He hath lost his way

Samson martyr rage.
Soon the world will pay.

——As performed by the bard Maryden Halewell
