Now gather ye drunkards, that's how these begin,
The songs of our heroes, of wars and our kin.
Well, now the fight's ours,
And none of us cowers,
We'll drink to all hours 'cause we know we can win!

Oh,
They cut into heaven and called it a door,
The Herald will lead us to even the score.
We'll take back the sky, and we'll give them the floor.
We'll take back the sky, and we'll give them the floor!

The beast was upon us, our hopes all but drowned,
At our necks a monster, at our heels a hound.
But we found a fortress,
And it's frigging gorgeous!
So join in the chorus and down a new round!

Oh!
He cut into heaven, we said it before,
Andraste will guide us to even the score!
We'll take back the sky, and we'll give him the flo────or.
We'll take back the sky, and we'll give him the floor!

We look to our leader, and heft up our crest,
To show this Corypheus we're not impressed!
He thinks we've been mastered,
We'll beat down the bastard,
And then we'll get plastered, we're blest by the best!

O--------h!
He cut into heaven, now sing it once more,
Inquisitor! Lead us to even the score!
We'll take back the sky, and we'll give him the flo──────────or!
We'll take back the sky!
And feed him his lie!
And black his foul eye!
Let all arrows fly!
And then we'll have pie!
Die DIE die die DIE!
We'll take back the sky, and we'll give him the floor!
