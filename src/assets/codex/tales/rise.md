Find Me
Still searching
For someone
To lead me
Can you
Guide me
To the revolt inside me

Promise
Surviving
The Breach

Promise
Surviving
The Breach
In the Sky

Templar
Igniting
Fire inside me

Maker
Remind me
Gone are the days
Of our peace

Now we reside
In the great divide

No promise
Surviving
The Breach
In the Sky

——As performed by the bard Maryden Halewell
