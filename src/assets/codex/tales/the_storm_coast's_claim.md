On the Waking Sea I ply my trade.
<i> Wink, good ser, and tell a saucy tale! </i>
The yarns I spin do please the maids.
So buy the lads a round!

Oh, the Storm Coast may yet claim these bones,
But I'll sail until they do.
So tell the girls I'm coming home,
With coin enough for two.

Drowning in the waves, a girl I met.
<i> Wink, good ser, and tell a saucy tale! </i>
I plucked 'er up with a fishing net.
So buy the lads a round!

Oh, the Storm Coast may yet claim these bones,
But I'll sail until they do.
So tell the girls I'm coming home,
With coin enough for two.

In the Nocen Sea, swims a might beast.
<i> Wink, good ser, and tell a saucy tale! </i>
I'll show you the scar where he sank his teeth.
So buy the lads a round!

Oh, the Storm Coast may yet claim these bones,
But I'll sail until they do.
So tell the girls I'm coming home,
With coin enough for two.

A cheerful salt, that's what I be.
<i> Wink, good ser, and tell a saucy tale! </i>
A'shore for the night and seeking company.
So buy the lads a round!

Oh, the Storm Coast may yet claim these bones,
But I'll sail until they do.
So tell the girls I'm coming home,
With coin enough for two.
