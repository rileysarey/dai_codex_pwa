Soft Fade-touched light, in dream-lit tones, falls dark.
Each form a memory, recalled through parted lips,
That try to speak, fall silent. Before light marks
The dawn, from sleeping fingers she slips
Into the day, where averted eyes bend
To any but the other. Oathsworn
To Lion's call, yet here the two are broken.
As waxing sickle stands witness to the end
Of love's denial and secrets borne,
From parted lips, the words at last are spoken.

—From "Ameridan and the Mage," author unknown

This overly romantic portrait of illicit meetings between a mage and her lover was written sometime in the Divine Age. Though likely penned after Ameridan's disappearance, the work was said to be inspired by tales and rumors of the former Inquisitor's "lady-mage." By the Second Age, Chantry scholars had largely concluded that the piece did not refer to Ameridan at all, but to another man altogether. These scholars claim the poem's title was a later addition, meant to discredit the last Inquisitor's reputation. The poem was later deemed "problematic" and relegated to a list of banned works.
