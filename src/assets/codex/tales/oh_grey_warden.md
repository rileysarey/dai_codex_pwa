Oh, Grey Warden,
What have you done?
The oath you have taken
Is all but broken.

All is undone.
Demons have come
To destroy this peace
We have had for so long.

Ally or Foe?
Maker only knows.
Ally or Foe?
The Maker only knows.

The stronghold lives on,
And the army's reborn,
Compelled to forge on.
What will we become?

Can you be forgiven
When the cold grave has come?

Or will you have won,
Or will battle rage on?

Oh, Grey Warden,
What have you done?
The oath you have taken
Is all but broken.

All is undone.
Ash in the sun,
Cast into darkness
The light we had won.

——As performed by the bard Maryden Halewell
