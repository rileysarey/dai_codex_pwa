Empress of fire,
In the reign of the lion,
Eclipsed in the eye of
The empire of we Orlesians.

Empress of fire,
What season may come,
We fight for the day
You'll restore our heart
And bring us to glory.

We are forever
In your graces.

Empress of fire,
Save us, everyone.
The nation reviles,
The course is but run, and end has begun.

Empress of fire,
Believe in us all.


Embrace us with arms,
And dress us with swords,
And light up our hearts with blood so bold.

We are forever
In your graces.

Empress of fire,
In the reign of the lion,
Eclipsed in the eye of
The empire of we Orlesians.

Empress of fire,
What season may come,
We fight for the day
You'll restore our heart
And bring us to glory.

——As performed by the bard Maryden Halewell
