Elgar'nan, Wrath and Thunder,
Give us glory.
Give us victory, over the Earth that shakes our cities.
Strike the usurpers with your lightning.
Burn the ground under your gaze.
Bring Winged Death against those who throw down our work.

Elgar'nan, help us tame the land.


──Song to Elgar'nan, found in the Temple of Mythal, author unknown
