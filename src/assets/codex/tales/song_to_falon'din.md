The People swore their lives to Falon'Din
Who mastered the dark that lies.
Whose shadows hunger
Whose faithful sing
Whose wings of death surround him
Thick as night.

Lethanavir, master-scryer, be our guide,
Through shapeless worlds and airless skies.

──Song to Falon'Din, found in the Temple of Mythal, author unknown
