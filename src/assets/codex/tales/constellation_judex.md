Depicted as a downturned sword, the constellation Judex is oft-called "the Sword of Mercy" in common parlance—even though the sword image was assigned to these stars long before Andraste's time. "Judex" referred to the concept of justice in ancient Tevinter, and the downturned aspect of the sword indicated a guilty verdict—which, in those times, generally translated to execution.

Obviously, with its modern meaning and use as a symbol by the Templar Order, the old interpretation is frowned upon in scholarly circles.
