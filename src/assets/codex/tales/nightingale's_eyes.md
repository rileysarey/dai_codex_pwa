Nightingale's eyes—
What secret lies
In their worth?

Raven's tears they cry,
But all the while
They softly lie and spy on you.

Nightingale's eyes—
What will they find
Left behind?

Craven master spy,
With heart remiss
For those who could not find the truth.

We're blinded,
So we're hiding
Dying to be.

We're hiding
From the fighting,
Longing to see.

We're waiting
For someone to speak
And set us all free.

Nightingale's eyes
Can free the ties
On our hands.

Craven master spies—
Can they find
The key that can unlock the past?

We're hiding
From the fighting,
Longing to see.

We're waiting
For someone to speak
And set us all free… free.

——As performed by the bard Maryden Halewell
