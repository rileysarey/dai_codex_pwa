<i> The front cover of this novel has a group of armed men and women fighting a horde of imaginary monsters, while a winged horse with a horn flies in the background against an enormous rainbow. There's text on the back: </i>

<i> There is a note slipped into the novel. </i>

Enjoy the book, my dear! It's Lord Fleming's most ambitious yet. I'm not sure what a "moon-whale" is, and at times there is a <i> scandalous </i> amount of attention paid to young men's backsides, but I doubt that will put you off in the slightest.
