<i> From "Of Mechanical Obscura." The words of Three-Eyes' make one passage stand out: </i>

"What can this be?" To ask that question is prove oneself a craftsman, one who looks upon the raw and wonders what it can become. The Artificer is not of that ken, for she will look upon the same resource and wonder not how it can be elevated, but how it can be made to serve. There are no more words necessary.

<i> Multiple schematics follow. </i>
