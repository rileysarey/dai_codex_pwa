While some of my contemporaries dispute whether the Fifth Blight was a true Blight or merely a large darkspawn resurgence, historians agree that it began in the swamps of the Korcari Wilds on the southeastern border of Ferelden in the year 9:30 Dragon.

King Cailan Theirin was swift in responding to the threat, gathering the royal army, every Grey Warden in his country, and sending a call for aid to the Ferelden nobility. The assembled armies laid a trap in the ruins of Ostagar, hoping to crush the force before it reached civilization. But they failed.

Darkspawn overran the defenders of Ostagar and decimated the king and his army. They continued their advance into Ferelden unopposed. Only two Grey Wardens managed to escape the slaughter. And somehow, they came into possession of ancient treaties, which compelled the races of men to join arms against the massing horde.

<h3> Nature of the Beast... </h3>

<h4> If the Hero of Ferelden recruited the mages: </h4> The surviving Wardens made their way to Kinloch Hold, home of the Ferelden Circle, and conscripted the mages.

<h4> If the Hero of Ferelden recruited the Templars... </h4> The surviving Wardens made their way to Kinloch Hold, and assisted in annulling the Fereldan Circle of Magi, which had fallen to abominations. With the end of that tragic disaster, the Wardens conscripted the templars.

<h3> Nature of the Beast... </h3>

<h4> If Hero of Ferelden recruited the Dalish Elves... </h4> In desperation to find more allies, the Wardens journeyed into the Brecilian Forest, seeking the Dalish. The elves, too, joined the growing army.

<h4> If the Hero of Ferelden recruited the Werewolves: </h4> In desperation to find more allies, the Wardens journeyed into the Brecilian Forest, seeking the Dalish. The elves failed to uphold their treaty, but another answered in their place: Werewolves, straight out of Fereldan folktales, joined the growing army.

<h3> A Paragon of Her Kind </h3>

<h4> If the Hero of Ferelden destroyed the Anvil of the Void: </h4> Into the Deep Roads the surviving Wardens went, searching for Paragon Branka in hopes she could settle the unrest in Orzammar and unite the dwarves in the battle against the Archdemon. Branka could not be located, but another Paragon was found: the legendary Caridin, who forged a crown that ended all question of succession.

<h4> If Branka is not alive: </h4> Into the Deep Roads the survivors went, searching for Paragon Branka in hopes she could settle the unrest in Orzammar and unite the dwarves in the battle against the Archdemon. They found her, and she forged a crown that played a key role in sorting out the royal succession.

<h4> If the Hero of Ferelden reclaimed the Anvil of the Void: </h4> Into the Deep Roads the surviving Wardens went, searching for Paragon Branka in hopes she could settle the unrest in Orzammar and unite the dwarves in the battle against the Archdemon. Not only did the Paragon settle the matter of royal succession, but she also reclaimed the lost secrets of golem manufacture. An army of stone and steel joined the war effort.

<h3> A Paragon of Her Kind-Ruler of Orzammar </h3>

<h4> If Prince Bhelen is crowned king: </h4> Bhelen Aeducan was crowned king of Orzammar, and the dwarven armies marched for the surface.

<h4> If Lord Harrowmont is crowned king: </h4> Despite their successes, though, greater challenges were yet to come.
