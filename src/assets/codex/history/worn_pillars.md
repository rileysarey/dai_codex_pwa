<i> A sketch of the pillars, followed by another drawing imagining the pillars as part of a grand monument, with appended notes on the subject: </i>

The remains of the structures surely predate the Second Blight. Perhaps older. My knowledge of ancient Imperium architecture is limited. There are some similarities, but I'm uncertain of their origin. One of the miners thinks they're elven—of course this is based on a few carvings he found that "look sort of elfy." The pillars are unlike the ruins one sees in the Dales. Of course, these would be much older than anything found there.
