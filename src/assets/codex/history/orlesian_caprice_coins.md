Victory in the Grand Game is not merely determined by what one has at one's command, one's connections, and one's machinations, but what one is willing to give up.

The clearest example is the Caprice: each coin is traditionally a gift.They were once tokens of regard, favors for chevaliers from their lovers or patrons.Throwing them into a fountain was rooted in superstition: the token was offered as a sacrifice, a bribe to Andraste to keep the chevalier safe on the battlefield.The more one had to offer to the waters, the better one's chances of escaping the caprices of fate—hence the name.Over time, the superstitious aspects of the custom faded; now the Caprice is a mark of status.The more coins one has, the more public the spectacle of throwing them away: the stronger one's position in the Game.
