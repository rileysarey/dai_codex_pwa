We rededicate this jewel of Val Royeaux as the Summer Bazaar of the First Lion, to reflect the spirit of renewal that is at the heart of the capital and of our people. Let the strength of the four always guard the Grace of the Empire. Let the blossoms and promise of the changing seasons be a tribute to trade and public gathering. For here, in the name of the Lion Valmont, we will be an example to the world of how Orlesians respond to adversity.

Our way cannot be threatened, for it embodies the truth of tradition and the promise of progress. The Blight finds no purchase in the heart of commerce.

â€”A plaque dedicating the Summer Bazaar, "for victories earned and to come," placed in 5:30 Exalted.
