"I have heard the complaints. Some of you do not understand why we train in a castle in the wilderness when you're to seek out corruption among the masses. You question the Seekers' foresight. Doubt assails you. Why have you come to Therinfal? What can you learn here you could not on your own?

"Patience is what you will learn. With no city to distract or tempt you, you will practice. You will fail. You will suffer. And when we are done, you will be a rock upon which demons break.

"Now let us begin."

This transcription of a speech by Lord Seeker Alderai to a batch of students beginning advanced lessons is dated 7:70 Storm. The Seekers used Therinfal Redoubt as a training ground until around 8:99 Blessed, when their finances were insufficient to keep the fortress in desirable condition.

The throne in the Great Hall of Therinfal Redoubt is not for mortal men. It is the Throne of the Maker, a reminder of His absence from our world caused by our sins. Its seat will be kept empty until He returns to His children. It is a reminder we must win back His favor with vigilance, faith, and absolute servitude.

Anyone caught sitting in it again will be disciplined severely.

—Note from Lord Seeker Alderai to his students, 7:72 Storm
